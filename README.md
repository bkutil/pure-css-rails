# Pure CSS for Rails Asset Pipeline

Based on [pure.css](http://purecss.io/) version 0.2.0.

## Install

1. Add this to your Gemfile

    `gem "pure-css-rails"`

2. Run

    `$ bundle`

3. Add `pure` to application.css (Use `pure-nr` for non-responsive version)


    `*= pure`

4. Profit!

You don't need to add `normalize.css`, it is already included.
